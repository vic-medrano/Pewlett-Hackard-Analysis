# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help Pewlett Hackard prepare for the future by analyzing data to determine how many employees will soon be retiring. This analysis looks at how many employees in each department will be retiring as well as the titles that will be opening up and needing to be filled. Additionally, this data is intended to help managers look at retiring emplyees that may be eligible to participate in a mentorship program that the company is creating to slow the rate of employees leaving the company.
## Results
- There is a large percentage of employees at PH that will be retiring relatively soon.
- It is interesting that with this many employees and departments, there are only two managers. 
- The change in number of rows in retiring titles to unique titles shows us that there were a considerable amount of employees that held different roles and received promotions during their time with the company.
- The retiring titles table aslo shows that a large majority of employees retiring hold senior positions.

- Pewlett Hackard is a very large company. The image above shows how many employees are set to retire and in what roles. 72,458 positions will be open and needing to be filled as these employees begin to retire.
- There are 1,549 employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This may not be enough to mentor the next generation of PH employees for several reasons. This is a new program that has most likely not been frequently discussed with the new employees who may be already set on retiring and not wish to participate. Even if all eligible employees did participate, they would need to take on about 40 mentees in the program.
